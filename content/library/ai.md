- Weak AI (Specialized)
- Strong AI (General)
- Super AI (self-aware)


- Artificial intelligence - simulation of intelligent behaviour.
  - Machine learning - is a subset of ai, uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned.
    - Deep learning - subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model human decision-making.
- Neural networks - a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data. Are the reason why deep learning is so powerful.
  Backpropagation (uses a set of training data that match known inputs to desired outputs, an error function) -> Gradient descent -> Activation function -> Weights -> Bias
  more than 1 hidden layer -> deep neural network
- Cognitive Systems:
  - Weak AI (Specialized): Refers to AI systems designed and trained for specific tasks or domains.
  - Strong AI (General): Refers to AI systems with the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.
  - Super AI (Self-aware): Hypothetical AI systems that possess consciousness and self-awareness, surpassing human intelligence.


- Supervised learning - the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset.
  - Regression - predict a continuous value.
  - Classification - predict a discrete value. (Features -> properties)
  - Neural networks 

- Unsupervised learning - the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset. (clustering)
- Reinforcement learning - the algorithm learns by trial and error to achieve a clear goal. How to achieve the goal.

## Perceptrons
The simplest form of a neural network. It takes several binary inputs, x1, x2, x3, and produces a single binary output. The perceptron calculates the weighted sum of its inputs and then passes the sum through a step function to produce the output.
## Convolutional Neural Networks
Multi-layer neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns. They are used in image and video recognition, recommender systems, and natural language processing.
## Recurrent Neural Networks
Perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output depending on the previous computations. They are used in speech recognition, language modeling, and translation.

## NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- board array of linguistic to draw inferences from language
- can understand intent
- can identify emotions

it is not speech-to-text or text-to-speech

## Self-driving cars
- radar data
- lidar data
- vision data
- laser data


## Lesson Summary
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand the meaning of human language, including the intent and context of use. 
- Speech-to-text enables machines to convert speech to text by identifying common patterns in the different pronunciations of a word, mapping new voice samples to corresponding words.
- Speech Synthesis enables machines to create natural sounding voice models, including the voice of particular individuals.
- Computer Vision enables machines to identify and differentiate objects in images the same way humans do.
- Self-driving cars is an application of AI that can utilize NLP, speech, and most importantly, computer vision.
